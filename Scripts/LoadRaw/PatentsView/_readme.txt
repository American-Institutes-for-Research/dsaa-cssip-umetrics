Hello and welcome to the PatentsView readme file!

The PatentsView database is created from the Flemming USPTO database.  To this end, you
will need a copy of select tables from the Flemming database on the database instance
where you intend to run the CreatePatentsViewDatabase.sql script.

In order to minimize documentation maintenance, I leave it to the reader to peruse the
CreatePatentsViewDatabase.sql script to figure out what those tables are.  There is
copious documentation therein.

You're welcome!
